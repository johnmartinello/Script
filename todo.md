1. Instead of having the scenes as root, you first need to create a project, which has scenes in it
2. you should be able to open the editor of a project, which will then mount the graph connections into a single "unified script" (in the editor page)
    - if there's branching scenes, it should have a comment under the title of the scene whats the condition
3. You can create different scenes without having to click in the new scene button. 
    - For each scene heading in the text, it should automatically create a new scene (numbered. TODO: figure out how to number branching scenes)
